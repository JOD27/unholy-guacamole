Chivalry is not dead.

Starting up the keyboard:
1. Click the setup button and wait for the countdown to end (we found it took approximately 30 seconds for the keyboard to initialise)
2. Go into settings -> 'language and input' -> 'keyboard and input methods' -> 'set up input methods' and enable the keyboard
3. Go into settings -> 'langauge and input' -> 'keyboard and input methods' -> 'current keyboard' and set the current keyboard to 'uholy-gaucamole'
4. Enjoy your new-found chivalry and all the benefits that come with it!
